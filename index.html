    <h4>abilities of madara uchiha</h4>
    <p1>He was able to switch between both d≈çjutsu. With the Rinnegan, Madara could use all of the abilities of the Six Paths Technique, such as the Preta Path to absorb chakra and the Deva Path to perform Chibaku Tensei. He could also use the Outer Path to create chakra chains that could restrain all nine tailed beasts.</p1>
    <h5>strengths </h5>
    <p2>As the Ten-Tails Jinchuuriki, Madara possesed unrivaled strength and power. According to Sakura, Madara's chakra level was from a whole different dimension compared to Obito as the ten tailed jinchuuriki. Madara can fly and has the ability to use the Truth Seeking Balls.</p2>
    <h6>personality </h6>
    <p3>Madara Uchiha was a firm believer in the way he wanted to do things, which often isn't the case with Naruto villains. While all of them start off with great conviction, fighting against Naruto and listening to him usually changes their mind and they end up becoming good.</p3>
    <h7>age at death</h7>
    <p4>Izuna died at age 24 and Madara is supposed to be older. So he was at least 74 when he died, more likely around 80. No idea about Hashirama, though</p4>
